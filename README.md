# Learn Git

**Git** is a tool for managing changes to your project. If there are going to be lots of developers all working on the same thing, having control of those changes is going to be important.

Everything that you do in Git revolves around four main concepts:

- Branches
- Commits
- The working directory
- The .git repository
