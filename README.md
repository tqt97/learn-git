# Learn Git

**Git** is a tool for managing changes to your project. If there are going to be lots of developers all working on the same thing, having control of those changes is going to be important.

Everything that you do in Git revolves around four main concepts:

- Branches
- Commits
- The working directory
- The .git repository

### 1. First commit

Let's make a start by initializing a repository and add an initial commit to it.

Initialize a git repo

```
git init
```

Add changes to the staging area

```git add <filename>```

or ```git add .``` to add all changes

Commit changes to the repository

```git commit -m 'your messsage goes here'```
